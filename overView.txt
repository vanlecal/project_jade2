I want to create a class attendance wedapp using MERN stack, students can log into their accounts and add their, 
name and index number.  A lecturer can use the app to generate a bar code after a class section,  students then 
use the app to scan the qr code and have their names,  index numbers and current gps locations, and other data saved in the lecturer's 
dashboard with respect to that specific QR code

- A class attendance webapp
- A lecturer generate a QR code with a respective name using the app
- Students scan the QR code using the app and their bio data is saved to the lecturer's
  dashboard of that respective QR code.
  (Name, Index Number, Phone Number, GPS, etc)
- The lecturer can view the attendance of all students who have scanned the QR code in his dashboard for every saved individual
QR code
- The QR code generated by the lecturer refreshes every 5mins for security reasons

I'm developing an attenace applicationn using MERN stack, My node express backend is up and ready, now I'm supposed currently work on the lecturer dashboard, use this sketch how you think the dashbaord should look in a simple basic functionality.
Use tailwind and shadcdn to create beautiful and responsive design 

LecturerUser,
GenerateQR: component for generating QR codes for class sessions,
SessionList: component showing a list of sessions

Now my problem is I'm supposed to add a kind of alert system in the lecutrer's dashboard which alerts the lecutrer if a student misses his lecutre for 3 times.
But can this system be implemented since the same lecturer can coduct different lecutre seassions with different class.

Additionally I'm suppossed to add an alert system prompting a student user too to scan the qr code for attendance when a lecturer has a seassiom in that specific class and opens a qr attendance code for the class to scan
